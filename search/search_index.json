Sometimes we don't have sufficient time, Sometimes we don't have the willpower to do some boring tasks. Sometimes we just lost our priority due to a large number of tasks. Find the right productivity method for yourself and finish the tasks effectively. One of the most difficult things in life is maybe to know yourself. Writing a journal helps you to know yourself.

Creating a good habit to consume information in this world of information overload is a key competence. We are not only consumers using the river of knowledge, but also participants in the river of knowledge. We use it to exchange our experiences and opinions with others and also share our knowledge. The tower of knowledge is a place, where we consume the external information effectively and also create our thought. Here don't forget to ask about the purpose of consuming the information: What kind of knowledge (information) do I need, to ...? For me, the question is: What kind of knowledge do I need to complete my projects and reach my goals? It's quite complicated to make each part work correctly and keep them interactive with each other smoothly, isn't it? It's important, that we from time to time step back and review each part and the complete system.

The bottom-up approach is more suitable to generate original insight from daily random ideas. This vault is designed to support this process.
