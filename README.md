# README
LMS (Life Management System) is a personal knowledge management system and goal & project management system based on Obsidian.md. 

The LMS is a complex interactive system. To make it easy to understand, I consider the LMS as a medieval town.  This town has 6 main districts. For more explanation about LMS as a medieval town see:
