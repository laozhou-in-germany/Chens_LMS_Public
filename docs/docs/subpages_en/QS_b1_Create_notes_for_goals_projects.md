# Create Notes for Goals and Project

## Note types

There are 7 note types for goals and projects:

1. Pillar: important life area
2. Value goal: goal or vision in a life area (pillar), not quantified
3. Outcome: quantified deliverable to achieve the value goal
4. Project: A series of actions to achieve a milestone of an outcome
5. Video project: similar to the project, but optimized for creating videos
6. Routine: Repeated activities to achieve a certain value goal
7. Mindset: Mindsets required to achieve a certain value goal
