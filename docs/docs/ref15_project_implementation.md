Sometimes we don't have sufficient time, Sometimes we don't have the willpower to do some boring tasks. Sometimes we just lost our priority due to a large number of tasks. Find the right productivity method for yourself and finish the tasks effectively. 

There are a lot of productivity methods. If a productivity method works for someone, depends on a lot of factors: the personal character, the tasks, and the implementation of the method. Everyone should find the productivity methods, which work for him. Here are the popular methods:

4. Pomodoro
5. Delegating
6. Create a system
