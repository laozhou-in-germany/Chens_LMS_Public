# Goals & Projects



![LMS_castle](../images/LMS_castle.PNG)



## Note types

6 note types are used for goals & projects:

- 🏛Pillar 
- 🌟Value goal
- 🎯Outcome
- 💎Project
- 🔁Routine
- 🤯Mindset

**The pillars** are the important life areas. e.g. finance, health, family. 

**The value goals** are the desired direction in each pillar, they are normally not concrete, not quantified, but a clear statement about our dreams. e.g. "I want to have a healthy lifestyle" or "I'd want to be a good husband."

**Outcomes** are the concrete deliverable for achieving the value goals. They must be quantified, terminable and actionable. e.g. " Go swimming 10 times this year" or "Celebrate wedding anniversary every year". Make sure, that the defined outcomes really serve the value goals and also sufficiently. 


## Workflow

- Distill literature notes

### Value Goal

- Link atomic notes to evergreen notes

### Outcome

- Garden evergreen notes

### Project

- Consolidate topics from literature notes, atomic notes, evergreen notes and sub-topic notes. 
- Connect topic notes to the home node

### Routine

### Mindset




# Projects Implementation


![LSM_place](../images/LSM_place.PNG)

After the project plan is done, the next step is the project implementation. There are a lot of productivity methods. They may support us to complete the tasks in the project effectively. If a productivity method works for someone, depends on a lot of factors: the personal character, the tasks, and the implementation of the method. Everyone should find the productivity methods, which work for him. Here are the methods, which work for me:

1. Eat the frog
2. Time blocking
3. Get things done
4. Pomodoro
5. Delegating
6. Create a system
7. Checklist

The project implementation is although part of the life management system. It is not implemented in Obsidian. Other special tools may support it better, e.g. Todoist. The usage of the tools and methods are not described here.
