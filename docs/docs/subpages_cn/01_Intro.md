# Intro

Hi Everybody,

Since the last year, I have begun to use obsidian.md as my notetaking software.  I found a way to combine different aspects of notetaking in a workflow, at least for my notetaking style. They are

- Goal and project management
- Journaling
- Personal knowledge management (PKM)
- Review and plan

I call it LMS (Life Management System), as it handles the most important areas of my life.

The main reference to build the workflow are:

- [August Bradley - Life Design - PPV](https://www.youtube.com/user/augustbradley/featured)

- [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/)
- Progressive summarization from [Forte Labs](https://fortelabs.co/)
- Zettelkasten from Niklas Luhmann

if you are also trying to combine different approaches in your notetaking workflow, or just searching for a vault template, which provides sufficient features out of the box. My templates and workflow may give you some help. So, I decided to share my vault template and create a guide for the workflow.

## The template vault

The template vault is hosted on GitHub. [laozhou-in-germany/Chens_LMS_Public](https://github.com/laozhou-in-germany/Chens_LMS_Public)
