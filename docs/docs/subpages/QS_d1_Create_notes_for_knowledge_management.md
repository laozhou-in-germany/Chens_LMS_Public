# Create Notes for knowledge management

## Note types

There are 4 note types for knowledge management:

1. Literature note: records of external information  
2. Atomic note: a small piece of reusable external information  
3. Evergreen note: a single idea of me (insight, opinion...)
4. Topic note: a consolidated collection of notes about the same topic

The 4 note types are linked with each other. In short, the connections are the following: 

- **Literature notes** are records of external information. 
- **Atomic notes** are extracted from **literature notes**.
- **Evergreen notes** are generated from **literature notes**.
- **Topic notes** are consolidated results of the three note types above and sub-topic notes.

[^1]: After the renaming of the note, an error message is shown for all dataview code blocks. "Evaluation Error: ..." It doesn't impact the function. By the next reload of the note, all dataview code blocks should work.   

[^2]: **Spaced repetition:** The note will be shown automatically on the dashboards "510_üìîLiterature_Notes" or "550_üå≤Evergreen_Notes" and "500_Knowledge_Management" after a certain period for the next review, depending on the **score**, **reviewed** and **last-review** in the front matter.  

[^3]: **Context-aware resurfacing:** The note will be resurfaced automatically while editing literature notes, evergreen notes, or topic notes with the same tag. 

[^4]: **Consolidation helper:** All notes with the **related tag** are listed below **unprocessed**. The notes will disappear, as soon as they are referenced within the topic (using outlink).
