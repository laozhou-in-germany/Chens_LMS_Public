# Develop notes for knowledge management



## 5 Steps of the bottom-up approach 

There are generally two approaches to taking notes: the top-down and the bottom-up approaches.

The bottom-up approach is more suitable to generate original insight from daily random ideas. This vault is designed to support this process. Of cause, you can also use the top-down approach in this vault. The bottom-up approach  includes five steps: 
- Distill literature notes
- Link atomic notes
- Garden evergreen notes
- Develop topics 
- Link topics to the home node


### Distill literature notes
It's suggested to use progressive summarization [^1] from Tiago Forte to read the literature. it contains the following steps.
1.  Note
2.  Bold passage using "** **"
3.  Highlight passage using "== =="
4.  Mini-summary using admonition "~~~ad-summary"
5.  Remix

Meanwhile, You should extract information from the literature note:  atomic notes and evergreen notes, which resonate with you.

### Link atomic notes
The atomic notes don't have a sense if they are not used later. So try to use the wiki link "[[atomic note]]" to link atomic notes in evergreen notes or topics.

### Garden evergreen notes

The maturity level of the evergreen notes increases with additional external knowledge (literature note) and own experience (insight from the journal and other evergreen notes).  The integrated features in vault spaced repetition and context-aware resurfacing support retouching the previous evergreen notes at a suitable time and naturally growing the evergreen notes. 

### Develop topics 

All knowledge notes with the same tag are collected in a topic note. Use the topic note as a workspace to sort, structure and unify the notes. The contradiction between the notes should be solved. The consolidation helper supports you to identify unprocessed notes.

### Link topics to the home node
All top-level topics should be linked to the home node. This makes the navigation of the notes later easier.
