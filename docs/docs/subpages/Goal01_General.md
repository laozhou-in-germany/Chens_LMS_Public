![LMS_castle](images/LMS_castle.PNG)



## Note types

6 note types are used for goals & projects:

- 🏛Pillar 
- 🌟Value goal
- 🎯Outcome
- 💎Project
- 🔁Routine
- 🤯Mindset

**The pillars** are the important life areas. e.g. finance, health, family. 

**The value goals** are the desired direction in each pillar, they are normally not concrete, not quantified, but a clear statement about our dreams. e.g. "I want to have a healthy lifestyle" or "I'd want to be a good husband."

**Outcomes** are the concrete deliverable for achieving the value goals. They must be quantified, terminable and actionable. e.g. " Go swimming 10 times this year" or "Celebrate wedding anniversary every year". Make sure, that the defined outcomes really serve the value goals and also sufficiently.
